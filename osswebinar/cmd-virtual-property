Description - Demo using virtual repo with user permission and properties to manage artifact lifecycle.  Use each curl commands as talking points. 

Example - Developer deploy file to developer accessiable repository i.e. snapshot
curl -u dev1:jfrog -X PUT "http://104.197.78.59:8081/artifactory/maven-snapshot-local/iamdeveloper.txt" -T iamdeveloper.txt
------------------

Example - Developer deploy file to developer accessbile repository using virutal repository -note it goes to maven-snapshot-local
curl -u dev1:jfrog -X PUT "http://104.197.78.59:8081/artifactory/maven-snapshot-virtual/iamdeveloper.txt" -T iamdeveloper.txt
-----------------

Example - Developer deploy file to repos without deploy access - expect errors. 
curl -u dev1:jfrog -X PUT "http://104.197.78.59:8081/artifactory/maven-staging-local/iamdeveloper.txt" -T iamdeveloper.txt
-----------------

Example - QA find all the snapshot builds, change the getstaging.xml to maven-release-virtual to look for relesae versions.  
# Find all the builds on staging
curl -uqa1:jfrog -X POST "http://104.197.78.59:8081/artifactory/api/search/aql" -Tgetstaging.aql
-----------------

Example - Now lets move the staging build that has been approved by QA to release - this requires Pro and illustration of what Pro can do. 
-----------------
curl -udev1:jfrog -X POST "http://104.197.78.59:8081/artifactory/api/copy/maven-staging-local/org/jfrog/test/multi3/3.99?to=/maven-release-local/org/jfrog/test/multi3/3.99"

jfrog rt cp maven-staging-local/org/jfrog/test/multi3/3.99/* /maven-release-local/org/jfrog/test/multi3/3.99/*
